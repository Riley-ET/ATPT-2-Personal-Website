# ATPT-2-Personal-Website
This will be my second attempt to utilize git/GitHub and to work on how to actually use all of these programs as a self learning coder. 

I am starting the repository on 4/27/2023 
  Right now I have s small blurb about myself and what I am doing with my website and a picture.
  I was able to shift the picture to the left and and wrap the text to the right of the picture. 
  I was also able to manipulate the picture and alter the size and shape so it look slike an icon rather than a jpeg sitting in the middle of a web page. 
  At the moment I thinking about what else I want to add and where to go from where I am at now.
  I am using a combination of analog and digital notes to create a wire frame of what I want to do with the webpage. (I use Concepts for digital ideas)
  I do not know if I should use figma but I would just need to do some more research.
