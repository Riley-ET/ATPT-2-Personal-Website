  actually learning how to code is really awkward...
</h2>
<p>It's interesting to know that html isn't considered coding but it's needed to make every single website. One thing I am intereted in is how to take notes for coding but I have heard that it isn't good or common practice to do that but i feel like i meed a cheat sheet with html notation so i can work on remembering them. I know you can use notion to display code but I'm not sure.</p>
